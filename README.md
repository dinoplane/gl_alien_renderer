# Gl Boids (A sandbox project as of now)

This project is a sandbox for the areas I want to improve upon (i.e. )

Currently, I have added the following features:

- [Craig Reynold's Boids](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~dt/siggraph97-course/cwr87/)
- Realistic Ocean Waves with help from [GPU Gems](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems/part-i-natural-effects/chapter-1-effective-water-simulation-physical-models) and this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PH9q0HNBjT4)


I plan to make this look way better. I really just need to find the time. My current goals for this project are:

- Improve the waves. I made it so that the light can be seen underwater, but I'm not exactly sure if it's correct.
- A new boid behavior? Not sure what I should do.
- A debug interface. I should play around with compute shaders so that I can see the normals of the objects I render. Not sure how to implement the window though.
- Sounds (they do improve the experience...)

But yea, I hope I can continue playing around with this!
