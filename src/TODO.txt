TODO Abstract organize the logic better
- A scene data vs a scene
    - Honestly, the scene data could be a file, and the scene could have a load from file method.
a renderer takes in a const Scene&, a const Framebuffer& and a const cameraIndex
- A renderpass system
- Loading models
- *GPU Frustum Culling + standalone models
- *GPU Frustum Culling + instancing
- lighting
- baked lighting + instancing... damn im gonna regret this aint i
- *add tracy to the app
- Use git submodules? Debatable
- * add a fumo
- Make sure to delete all buffers after exiting // eeeeeeehhh?
    There's no point if memory is not in demand in the lifetime.
    The program will release all its resources upon exit anyway!
    My excuse for allowing memory leaks lol!


DONE
- Multiple Cameras
- Multiple Renderers
- Post processing logic
- Instancing with vertex attributes
- Instancing with SSBO
- CPU Frustum Culling
- Adding IMGUI
