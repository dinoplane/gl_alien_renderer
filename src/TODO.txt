TODO Abstract organize the logic better
- A renderpass system
- lighting
- baked lighting + instancing... damn im gonna regret this aint i

- Get rid of include clutter

- indirect draws
- deferred shading

Bugs:
- fix noninstanced model shader (im lazy so i dwanna right now)
- cirno's eyes get gouged out sometimes... figure out why


Capstone TODOs:
- Implement an L system


DONE
- Add material to the scene 
- GPU Frustum Culling + standalone models
- untangle shader interfaces
- Loading models
- add a fumo
- A mesh is an array of primitives
- a model is an array of nodes, pointing to said meshes
- GPU Frustum Culling + instancing
- Multiple Cameras
- Multiple Renderers
- Post processing logic
- Instancing with vertex attributes
- Instancing with SSBO
- CPU Frustum Culling
- Adding IMGUI
- Add tracy to the app
- A scene data vs a scene
    - Honestly, the scene data could be a file, and the scene could have a load from file method.
a renderer takes in a const Scene&, a const Framebuffer& and a const cameraIndex


CUT: 
- Make sure to delete all buffers after exiting // eeeeeeehhh?
    There's no point if memory is not in demand in the lifetime.
    The program will release all its resources upon exit anyway!
    My excuse for allowing memory leaks lol!
- Use git submodules? Debatable
    Don't wanna mess with this, in production code, using public modules is tied to legality issues,
